/**
 * This class is a demonstration of what a entry point Java Class will look like.
 * This will be heavily used during the first few sessions.
 * 
 * Everything that we do in Java is within a class.  A class is a compartmentalized unit
 * of work which has 1 key thing to do.
 * 
 * Using a bike as an example, you would have at least the following classes to represent it:
 * Bike:
 *   - Wheel
 *   - Body
 *   - Handlebars
 *   
 * This class is "public" because we want any external classes to be able to see and access it.
